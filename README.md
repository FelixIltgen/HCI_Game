# HCI_Game
### Exam submission in the HCI in Games module at Offenburg University of Applied Sciences.
This project is an examination assignment that was created in connection with the HCI in Games module of my Master's program at the HS Offenburg. The examination consisted of a term paper on HCI in Games and an additional practical part which consisted of the realization of a game prototype which uses an alternative input method and does not use the typical key inputs such as W/A/S/D.
## Game idea
My idea was to develop a game with audio input. The aim was to use the audio input as the main input option and to query it via common headsets or built-in microphones.
# Handlung im Spiel
The aim of the game is to make a tree grow by directing a rain cloud over the tree. This gives the tree water and takes it to the next growth stage. If the cloud moves outside the playing field, it will break. The cloud is controlled by voice input. Each cloud moves across the playing field at a constant speed. The player must ensure that the cloud always moves within the playing field by blowing.
## Hausarbeit
The main part of this project was to write the term paper, in addition to which the prototype was to be implemented to support the hypotheses from the term paper. The requirements of the prototype were on the implementation and not on the graphical realization.
